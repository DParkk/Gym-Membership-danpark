# Motivational Gym

## Task 2

- This application will
allow people to register a **Gym Membership** and encourage people
to work out by showing their **InBody Information** such as bmi and lbm.

- For registering a gym membership, a client will be prompted to enter their 
name, date of birth, contact number, emergency contact, ID(name), and password(4-digit).

  Then, the clients will be prompted to enter their age, sex, height, and weight. With those information, 
it will provide their BMI, and LBM (Lean Body Mass). Then clients will also
 know if their BMI or LBM is normal compared to average scale. Also, there will be some advice depending 
on their InBody scale.

  Lastly, they will input their run-distance(km) for the day. Then comparing with other members, they will know
 their place depending on their run distance.
- This application is targeted to people who are trying to work out and want to
see their work-out progress with InBody information.
- This idea was tempting to me because when I visited a fancy gym in Korea,
the gym offered some free InBody information. So I thought it will be motivating for people to know their
InBody information anytime without any cost in gym. The advice they will be provided such as
recommended diet and work-out routine will motivate their work-out journey even more!
The last part where they can compete with their run-distance will give more fun and competition between gym members.
