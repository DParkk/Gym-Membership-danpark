# "Motivational Gym"

- This application will
allow people to register a **Gym Membership** and encourage people
to work out by showing their **InBody Information** such as bmi and lbm.

- For registering a gym membership, a client will be prompted to enter their 
*name, date of birth,* and *contact number*.

  Then, the clients will be prompted to enter their *age, height*, and *weight*. With those information, 
it will provide their BMI. Then clients will also
 know if their BMI is normal compared to average members in the gym. Also, there will be some advice depending 
on their InBody score.

- This application is targeted to people who are trying to work out and want to
see their work-out progress with InBody information.
- This idea was tempting to me because when I visited a fancy gym in Korea,
the gym offered some free InBody information. So I thought it will be motivating for people to know their
InBody information anytime without any cost in gym. The advice they will be provided such as
recommended diet and work-out routine will motivate their work-out journey even more!
The part where they can compete with their run-distance will give more fun and competition between gym members.  

## "User stories"
- As a user, I want to be able to add a infinite amount of member's information to the gym.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a "run-distance" to "run-distance" of gym members.
- As a user, I want to see my place for "run-distance" among the gym members.
- As a user, I want to be able to see my BMI score.
- As a user, I want to be able to check if my BMI score is in the average or not.
- As a user, I want to see an interface where I can input my personal information for a membership register.
